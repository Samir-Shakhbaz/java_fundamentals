// Ryan Note: this formatting needs to be fixed. This class should also contain the main() method that
// starts the game/application.

// Ryan Note: I would recommend building and testing the game piece by piece, step by step. At the moment,
// I don't see a main() method anywhere, or any testing that you're doing of basic functionality as you progress.
// For instance, in the main() method, you could be creating players, creating hands, dealing cards, checking scores,
// etc as you progress. At the moment, it appears as though you're trying to code the entire thing without testing
// it along the way. But I may be missing something, or just not seeing the main() method or the primary game loop.
