/**
 * Lambdas Exercise 4:
 *
 *      Stream API Labs
 *
 *      1) Demonstrate the use of the range function to print out the numbers 1 through 15 (inclusive)
 *      2) Demonstrate the use of the sum function to determine the range of a set of numbers.
 *      3) Demonstrate the use of the map() function to alter each int in a List of Integers, then use the sum function
 *          to get the sum of the modified list
 *      4) Demontrate the filter function by filtering out all Integers that are less than 10 - then use the average
 *          function to average the remaining numbers, assign this result to an int variable.
 *      5) Demonstrate the reduce() function to determine the sum of a list of Integers
 *      6) Demontsrate how to Stream a text file and print out each line
 *      7) Demonstrate how to Stream the stream_text_lab.csv file in this package. Split the lines into String arrays,
 *          the print out the element at the 1 index for each array.
 *      8) Demonstrate how to Stream the stream_text_lab.csv file in this package. Split the lines into String arrays,
 *          the print out the sum of all elements at index 2.
 *      9) Demonstrate the anyMatch() function.
 *      10) Demonstrate the allMatch() function.
 *      11) Demonstrate the collect() terminal operation to store resulting values into a List
 *
